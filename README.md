Final Year Project (FYP): Vision-Based Speed Sorting System

This is the culmination of my final year project, where I've designed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) utilizing the PyQT5 library for information display.
 This project focuses on the detection of Aruco markers using an industrial-grade machine vision camera typically employed in automation industries.
 The camera is expertly configured through a Raspberry Pi controller, and it interfaces with an IR sensor to generate signals for communication with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).
